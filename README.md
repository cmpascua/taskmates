## Things you did in the code
This project is an integration of all the laboratory exercises I completed for my mobile app programming course. I spent a lot of time and effort to make it fully-featured and user-friendly. The app lets users create and manage their own tasks, as well as view that of their friends. To create a task, users have to specify the title, description, and deadline. On the friends page, users can add friends which would enable them to view each other’s tasks. This allows users to plan and work together on projects and tasks even if they’re located in different places. In conclusion, this application can be really helpful for users who need to share and manage tasks with their friends and collaborators.

## Challenges faced
Implementing task notifications were difficult to set up as I lacked the time to gain familiarity with the feature's implementation. In addition, the friends feature was a challenging one as well due to the complexity of the data structure needed to view and store the relationships between the users. Moreover, I had to make sure that any changes made to the data were reflected for all users in real time. Overall, it was a challenging project but I'm happy with the results.

## Test Cases
Happy paths:
  1. Once user launches the app, a login screen with an email field, password field, login button, and sign up button appears.
  2. Once user taps the sign up button, the sign up screen appears with a first name field, last name field, username field, location field, birthday field, email field, password field, sign up button, and a back button.

Unhappy paths:
  1. The user taps the add friend button to a user that is already their friend.
  2. The user taps the sign up button without entering any input to the required fields.
